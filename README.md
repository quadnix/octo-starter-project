Welcome to `Octo` - a general-purpose cloud infrastructure modeling tool.
This starter project is bootstrapped to give you a fresh TypeScript project,
so you can try and experiment with Octo as smoothly as possible.

## Getting Started
### Update package.json
1. Choose appropriate values for `description`, `name`, and `private`.
2. If you want a different license, please choose appropriate values for `license`,
and change `LICENSE` file accordingly.
3. Run husky - `npm run prepare`
